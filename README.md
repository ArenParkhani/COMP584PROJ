Created a Web Application To Create and Store Jokes

Jokes can be made by different users after they login with individual accounts

User Names will then be stored by the jokes they created for the application

This is a prelimnary idea just as a proof of concept for the applications function, in the future the use case will probably be changed to some other topic other than jokes.
